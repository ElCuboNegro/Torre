#    h. The payments of Apple computers employees, contracted by Foxxconn, are way below

# 2. You are aware on 6th September 2021, Ethical Consumer viewed the entry for Apple
#    Inc on the Opensecrets.org website, which was published in the USA by the Centre
#    for Responsive Politics. This stated that in 2020 the company had spent $7,410,000
#    on lobbying and in 2020 the company and its employees had made $6,758,150 in
#    political donations.

#    to determine what, if any, memberships Apple Inc has with entities considered by
#    Ethical Consumer to be lobby groups. According to the Ethical Consumer lobby group
#    members list, updated in February 2021, Apple was a member of the following lobby
#    groups:
#
#       World Business Council for Sustainable Development
#       Business Roundtable
#       European Services Forum
#       World Economic Forum

#    groups which exerted undue corporate influence on policy-makers in favour of
#    market solutions that were potentially detrimental to the environment and human
#    rights.
